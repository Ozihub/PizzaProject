+ The analysis showed the best and worst perfoming pizza category (top 5) and its contibution to overall sales.
+ The analysis also showed the best and worst time of sales during the day(hourly), weekly and yearly basis.
+ It helped to identify customers preferences of pizza sizes and its impact on sales.

## SOLUTIONS
 + The analysis proved that the Brie Carrie contributed to the minimum revenue made from sales and orders, therefore the management of the company should produce it in minimum quantity or put a discount on it to save time and resources.
 + The company runs a 24hours business. From the analysis, I observed the hourly trend of pizza sold; which the peak hours of sales is between 12/1 o'clock, it decreases and then increases at 5,6 &7pm. The management can manage time and resources by adjusting opening hours to 10am in the morning, employ more staff for peak hours to meet orders of customers.
